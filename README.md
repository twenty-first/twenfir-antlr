# twenfir-antlr
A small support library for the ANTLR parser generator. Currently provides a framework for creating AST's, a TokenSource that logs to SLF4J and a method that finds a file in a list of directories and returns its contents. Still work in progress. Semantic versioning will be supported, but no guarantees are given as long as version is in the 0.0.x range.
